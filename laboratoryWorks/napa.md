##Conclusion
By analyzing the results it can be reasonably said that the algorithms don't have the same complexity. The thing is, in a given interval of time, the algorithms converge in a different way. 
When doing the recursive implementation of fibonacci algorithm, you are adding redundant calls by recomputing the same values over and over again. 
Iterative functions â€“ are loop based imperative repetitions of a process (in contrast to recursion which has a more declarative approach).
This is the main difference between these approaches. <br />
P.S. There are lots of algorithms for computing fibonacci that can be found on google.
