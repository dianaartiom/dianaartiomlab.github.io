##Laboratory Work No.1
In this laboratory work we had to deal with installing a normal operating system, Ubuntu (Server), in VirtualBox. Basically it was nothing difficult. I installed VirtualBox using <br \>
```$
sudo apt-get install virtual-box
```
<br \>
The next thing I`ve done was downloading the Ubuntu Server image and installing it in VirtualBox. Having the IP address I connected my machine to the virtual one, by using SSH. The following image describes my actions:

####Basic Level
<ul>
  <li>Connect to a server using SSH</li>
